# BlockAttack
BlockAttack is a Tetris Clone Built with Plain Javascript.  This is an exploratory / demonstration project that I'm using to learn more about game development.  This project is also very new, so it will take time to develop an actual playable game.

# Blog Series
I'm writing a companion blog series which follows the development of BlockAttack and documents each incremental update.  You can read it on [My Website](https://mikebledsoe.com/blog).

# Play the Game
The most recent version of BlockAttack is available at [www.playblockattack.com](https://playblockattack.com).  As I said above, it's very early in the development phase, so there isn't anything to play yet.
